##*Description*
*I have been a fan of healthy eating and I have always tried to have a balanced diet. Therefore, having fruits and vegetables in my diet is necessary. This personal interest has prompted me to devise this application.
Since I am interested in making smoothies, I have thought of saving all the recipes in my google doc. 
The saving of the recipes has helped me to easily enter this information into Mango and Trilo.

My project works like this:
when we are at the page of the Smoothies, each of the smoothies have their own separate pages. Each of those smoothies have 6 buttons. The buttons are called:
Recipes / Like /Comment / Delete & Edit . Each of these buttons are linked to their own page.*
